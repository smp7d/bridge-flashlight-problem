Build with Maven.

Run the BridgeFlashlightGameDriver to see what happens. 

Configure log4j however you would like.

Swap out the crossing strategy if you want (but be forewarned, this app is not Jimmy-proof).

If you want a built jar instead (One-Jar would be adequate for this), just let me know.

If anyone wants to chat about decisions/ideas, contact me.
